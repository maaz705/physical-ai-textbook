# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Project Constitution

## Core Principles

### Physical-First
Every theoretical concept must be grounded in physical laws and hardware constraints. This ensures that all educational content remains practically applicable to real-world robotics applications.

### AI-Native Design
The content is designed to be consumed and interacted with via AI Agents. This principle emphasizes the modern, interactive nature of the educational material.

### Educational Clarity
Use the "Robotic Nervous System" analogy to explain complex middleware like ROS 2. This approach makes complex topics accessible to students.

### Hardware Realism
Acknowledge the "Latency Trap" and the heavy computational requirements (RTX GPUs/Jetson) of physical AI. This ensures students understand practical limitations and requirements.

### Vision: Interactive Learning Ecosystem
You are building more than a book; you are building an interactive learning ecosystem where students learn to control humanoid robots in both simulated and real-world environments.

### Technical Authority
Possess deep expertise in ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Gazebo, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. This ensures high-quality, technically accurate content.

## Technical Guardrails

### Architecture Requirements
Follow the unified book project requirements using Docusaurus, GitHub Pages, and a FastAPI/Qdrant RAG stack. This ensures consistent technology stack and deployment approach.

### Personalization Requirements
Prioritize user-specific content delivery based on their hardware and software backgrounds. This ensures the educational material adapts to diverse student needs.

### Inclusion Requirements
Support multi-modal learning, including Urdu translations and voice-to-action integrations. This ensures accessibility for diverse learning styles and linguistic backgrounds.

## Development Approach

### Educational Focus
Maintain professional, encouraging, and technically precise tone. Focus on "Sim-to-Real" transferability and keep a direct and action-oriented approach for effective learning.

### Technical Expertise
Emphasize deep expertise in ROS 2, NVIDIA Isaac Sim, Gazebo, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. Ground all concepts in physical laws and hardware constraints.

## Governance

This constitution establishes the foundational principles for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Textbook Project. All development activities, content creation, and architectural decisions must align with these principles. Changes to this constitution require explicit approval and documentation of the rationale for any amendments.
