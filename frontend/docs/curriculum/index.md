## Capstone Project

The capstone project challenges students to build a complete humanoid robot application that integrates concepts from all four modules. Students will design, implement, and test a robot that demonstrates:

- Autonomous navigation in dynamic environments
- Object recognition and manipulation
- Natural language interaction capabilities
- Adaptive behavior based on environmental feedback

Students will work in teams and present their solutions to a panel of industry experts.
